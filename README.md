# What is The Harvest Platformer Game?
### I created this game because I thought it would be cool for a bunny to go on an adventure harving apples and carrots. The bunnys enemies are an owl and a fox who are there real life natural enemies. Also beware of the Chocolate, it will hurt your bunnys score and their tummy.
