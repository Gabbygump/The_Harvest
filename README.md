#The Harvest - The only bunny adventure game on the market!
#### I created this game because I thought it would be cool for a bunny to go on an adventure harving apples and carrots. The bunnys enemies are an owl and a fox who are there real life natural enemies. Also beware of the Chocolate, it will hurt your bunnys score and their tummy. Here is the Link to the code!

 * You must have Python Version 3.4.4 and Pygame Version 1.9.2 in order for this game to work and for you to enjoy!! I used Idle to make my code :)


## How to Play

### Overview

#### The goal of the Harvest is to harvest all of the apples and carrotts in each level intill you have completed all 8 levels without dying. This is a hard thing to do because there are a bunch of diffrent difficult levels that you will have to complete including a underwater level and a space level. Be wear of the enemies( owls and foxs) they will make you lose lifes!!
